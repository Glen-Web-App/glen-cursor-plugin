name: use-artifact
description: Fetch and display an artifact from the org's shared Glen library. Use when the user asks to open, view, render, or download a saved Glen artifact.
---

1. **Find it.** If you don't know the slug, run `glen artifact search "<intent>"` via Bash and confirm the right one with the user.
2. **Fetch it.** Run `glen artifact get <slug>` via Bash. The output is the document (Markdown or HTML+CSS).
3. **Show it.**
   - **Markdown:** present it inline.
   - **HTML:** write it to a local `.html` file, then publish it as an artifact so it renders (ask to create an artifact from that HTML file). It is a self-contained page with no JavaScript.
4. **Always** share the dashboard link so the user has the canonical rendered copy: `https://app.tryglen.com/artifacts/<slug>`.
